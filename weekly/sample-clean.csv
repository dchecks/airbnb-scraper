BUT if you have stayed before or are desperate, message us and we will lift the block for the dates you want if we are able to. Awhi mai. Want to know more about our Air Bnb studio?Your accommodation is a fully furnished ground floor ensuite studio in a modern and warm eco designed house in St Albans in a cul de sac. The studio has its own private entry from a boardwalk and has its own patio and is set in a native garden.  You can come and go as you please. Self check in and out.This is a very warm and well insulated house with double glazing, your own heat pump, solar water plus many other eco non-toxic features in a quiet tree lined street close to buses or a 25 min walk from the city centre. (2.5km from Square.)  On street car parking. It is a 15 minute drive or shuttle from the airport and we are just off the main road heading north out of town.The studio has a hotel quality queen bed plus an inbuilt closet with shelves and rails for clothes. Also provided is a chest of drawers, bedside table, lamp plus a table and chairs, TV with Chromecast and a small sofa. The bathroom is perfect for relaxing in with a feature blue glass brick feature wall, separate shower and extra deep tub for soaking. The studio has a fridge, microwave, toaster and kettle so you can keep and make your own breakfast/snacks and reheat food or even cook it in the microwave. Crockery and cutlery provided. Please note there is no full kitchen and only snack/simple meal making facilities are provided in the studio.  A few starter herbal tea bags are provided for a welcome cuppa on arrival but breakfast and milk are not provided. There is a supermarket near by and  a 24 hour garage minimart if you need to grab supplies during your stay.The studio is best for a single person or couple as there is just one queen bed. The house was built to be as non-toxic as possible and has been maintained using environmentally friendly paints and cleaning products. Our water supply is filtered and so free of the chemicals now added to the local water supply. All linen is washed in eco-friendly detergent and sun dried. Please be aware that therefore our linen will not have a laundry detergent fragrance. We compost and recycle as much as possible. The land the house is on is used for growing fruit and vegetables and is managed using veganic and organic principles. It is just a normal suburban garden which has been designed to grow as much as possible and feeds us year round. Please note that this house is in a suburban neighbourhood and is part of a  home. The studio has had sound reduction features added so you should have a quiet stay but is not sound proof. It is possible you may hear noises from other people living in the same building if they are there or noise from the neighbours as one would expect in the suburbs though generally this should not be a problem and if it is, just tell us and if we can, we will try and sort it for you. However if you want a totally silent stay, it might be better to book a rural Air Bnb. Most guests though comment on how quiet it is here.Guest accessGuests have sole use of the studio and bathroom. Entry to the studio is down a wooden boardwalk through a native garden to your patio and door. Self check in.There are no stairs - just one step down to the boardwalk path to access the room and a step up at the end of it. The studio is at ground floor level.Other things to note11am check out. We can sometimes arrange a later check out on request depending on our circumstances and the next booking on that day. Please ask. Weekday 4pm check in.Weekend 1pm check in.We work and usually can't get the room ready for you before 4pm on a weekday or 1pm on the weekend. However if you want an earlier check in,  we will do our best to make it possible if we can. Please let us know if you need this. We almost always have guests the night before and as their check out is 11am, we just can't offer a morning check in sorry. So if you want an early morning check in and be guaranteed that the room is ready for you when you arrive from your long haul flight, we suggest you also book the night before so that the room is definitely available. It is usually no problem to drop off luggage earlier if you need to. Please let us know if you would like to do this. You can check in late no problem. So don't worry if your flight is landing at midnight or even later. We will arrange with you how to access the studio.If you wish to stay long term, we can make the studio available for longer stays than what is available on the calendar. Please contact us with your request.If you wish to stay an extra  night on either side of the available dates, please contact us and we will try to make this possible for you unless the room is already booked. The studio used to be part of the Lonely Planet recommended 'greenSpace Eco B&B'. At that time, our B&B had 3 guest rooms  and was very busy. However  we closed the B&B after the earthquake so as to make rooms available for permanent residents due to Christchurch's housing shortage which is now much better. This time we have decided not to do the whole busy B&B thing again and just have the one room available for guests.","Check-in: After 4:00 PM,Checkout: 11:00 AM,Not suitable for children and infants,No smoking,No pets,No parties or events",False,-43.50981,172.63463,,No parking on property: Free on street parking.
